### Tensors
ML generalization of vectors and matrices to any number of dimensions

### Norms
vectors represent a magnitude and direction from origin. Norms are functions that quantify vector magnitude. <br>
unit vectors: special case of vector where its length is equal to one.

### dot product

### Symmetric matrices
1. square
2. X^T = X

### Identity matrices
1. every element along main diagonal is 1
2. all other elements are 0
3. notation: I_n
